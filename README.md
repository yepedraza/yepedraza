## About me 🤔
Yahhō! ^^

I'm Yery Pedraza.  

I born in Bogotá.

Actually I'm currently finishing my studies as a professional on mechatronics engineering 🤖!

And I'm self-studying to be a machine learning engineer🤓, any tip it's welcome😉.

## About my repositories
Actually the most part of my repositories are projects and knowledges of my career and are developed in my study times but, I wanna start to create some personal projects focused on data sciences and other... *occasional things*🤭.

And that's it. If you want to communicate with me you can MD in the Twitter of my description 😊
